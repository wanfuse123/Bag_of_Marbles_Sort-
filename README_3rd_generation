Software Program for Advanced Array Sorting and Reconstruction using Subset Selection
Objective
The primary goal is to sort an array of integers, potentially up to quadrillions of elements, and reconstruct the original array based on sorted subsets. The program aims to measure the statistical effectiveness of the reconstruction process and explore the efficiency gains of sorting subsets instead of the entire array.

Requirements
Random Subset Selection and Sorting: Instead of sorting the entire original array, randomly select subsets of it and sort these subsets. This technique aims to speed up the sorting process for extremely large datasets.

Sorting Consistency: Both the original array and all subsets should be sorted in ascending order.

Variable Subset Sizes: The user should be able to select subsets of varying sizes, ranging from 10% to 100% of the original array, to test the minimum subset size needed for accurate reconstruction.

CSV File Output: Save the sorted subsets and the sorted original array in CSV files for subsequent analysis.

Performance Timing: Measure the time required to sort both the original array and each subset.

Memory and Disk Management: Utilize specialized techniques for efficient memory and disk management (detailed below).

Statistical Measurement: Incorporate algorithms to measure the statistical effectiveness of the reconstruction (detailed below).

Final Reconstructed Array: Generate a final reconstructed array based on the sorted subsets.

Memory Allocation Error Handling: Gracefully manage memory allocation errors.

Time Complexity
Expected Time Complexity: The use of subset selection aims to achieve an average time complexity better than traditional sorting algorithms for extremely large datasets. However, the exact time complexity would depend on the implementation details and optimizations.
Memory and Disk Management Techniques
Memory Partitioning: Divide large arrays into smaller chunks for independent processing.
Example: Divide a 1-trillion element array into 1000 chunks of 1 billion elements each.

Memory-Mapped File I/O: Map a file or its segment into the application's memory space.
Example: Use the mmap function in C.

Custom Swap-File System: Implement a swap-file system that moves portions of the array in and out of disk storage as needed.
Example: Maintain a "swap file" on disk for reading/writing array chunks.

Disk-based Sorting Algorithms: Use algorithms designed for sorting data in chunks loaded from disk.
Example: Implement disk-based merge sort.

Data Pointers and Indirect References: Use an array of pointers or indices to represent the original array during sorting.
Example: Sort an array of pointers pointing to the actual data.

Combined Approach for Enhanced Accuracy
Weighted Metrics: Use a weighted combination of various metrics for a more accurate measure of reconstruction effectiveness.

Cross-Validation: Use multiple subsets for reconstruction and average their effectiveness for a more robust measure.

Special Considerations: Boolean Arrays, Positional Tracing, and Distribution Interpolation
Boolean Arrays for Tracking and Reselection Prevention: Use Boolean arrays to keep track of which elements have been sorted in each subset and to prevent reselection of the same element in subsequent subsets. This is crucial for the operation of the sort.

Tracing Positional Changes: Record the original and new positions of each element in the array, enabling more precise statistical measures of the effectiveness of the reconstruction process.

Interpolation of Original Distribution: Employ statistical interpolation techniques to estimate the distribution of the original array based on sorted subsets.
